        <p> A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of aerospace engineering and scientific proposals <b>the late 1940s</b>.<br>
         Plans include landing on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos and Deimos. <br>
          Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and starting terraforming of the planet.

        <h2>Exploration of Mars</h2>
        <p>
        The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. <br>
         Conceptual work for missions that would involve human explorers has been ongoing since <b>the 1950s</b> , with planned missions typically being stated as taking place anywhere between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted. <br>
         The list of <b>crewed</b> Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. <br>
          Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization or other continuous humanization).<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization"><b> Info</b></a></cite> <br>
          Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, have also been proposed. <br>
        <em>In the 2010s ,</em> numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for human missions to Mars.<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_crewed_Mars_mission_plans"><b> Read More</b></a></cite> <br>
        In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films.
